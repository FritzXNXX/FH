    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>
      At the heart of our work is a commitment to excellence in web development.
      We focus on maintaining a clear separation between structure (HTML) and design (CSS),
      ensuring that our code is clean, maintainable, and adheres to web standards.
    </p>
    <p>
      By following best practices such as external styling and reusable components,
      we ensure our websites are both visually appealing and technically sound.

    <h4>Our Commitment to Accessibility</h4>
    <p>
      Accessibility is a core principle of our development approach.
      We believe that everyone, regardless of their abilities, should have equal access to information on the web.
      That's why we use semantic HTML and validate our code to meet accessibility standards.
